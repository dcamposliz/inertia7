                Abstract
            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This project focuses on finding the best statistical-learning model to predict future values for the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Stock Index</strong>.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Understanding the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Stock Index</strong> is highly-relevant in understanding the health of the U.S. economy as it is highly-correlated (statistically) with other U.S. economic indicators such as other stock indices (e.g. the NASDAQ Stock Index and the NYSE Stock Exchange), the U.S. Housing Price Index, and the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (U.S. GDP).
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Time-series analysis is a basic concept within the field of statistical-learning, which is appropriate for the analysis of the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Stock Index</strong>. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                For this project we leverage the horse-power of R and deliver, where appropriate, gorgeous data visualizations using d3.js and plotly.js
            </p>

                <br/>
                <p>
                    For this we use the <code>required()</code> method and include the package names as arguments. Make sure to first install the packages using the <code>install.packages("")</code> method if you haven't done so already.

            <p>
                Now we collect our data. We want to use reliable sources of complete and accurate data. We collected 21 years (1995-2015) of S&amp;P 500 Stock Index data at a monthly frequency (a total of 252 observations) from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EGSPC+Historical+Prices">Yahoo Finance</a>. You can do the same too.

            <h3>

            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                We cleaned our data manually using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1STR_wkkIUQVZT-PK0XAdEtmQQnjOzn0DkUPhTyWfolM/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a>. For this we made sure that all fields contained data (i.e. no missing values) and that the headers (i.e. column names) were labeled appropriately. This can be done programmatically with R, but this is outside of the scope of this project.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                 We also included a bunch of other variables (for exploratory analysis) such as the NASDAQ Stock Index, the NYSE Stock Exchange, the U.S. Housing Price Index, and the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Here is our data in file <a href="https://github.com/dcamposliz/timeSeries_sp500/blob/master/data.csv">data.csv</a>, which is ready to be used with R.
            </p>

            <h3>

            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Then we must include our data set within our working R environment. For this we use:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                dataMaster <- read.csv(" ...{PATH_TO}... /data.csv")
            </code>
            <br/>
            <code>
                attach(dataMaster)
            </code>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Now we can call our S&amp;P 500 Stock Index data by typing <code>dataMaster$sp_500</code> into our terminal.

            <br/>
            <p>
                Our S&amp;P 500 Stock Index data is in the form of time-series; this means that our data exists over a continuous time interval with equal spacing between every two consecutive measurements. In R we are able to create time-series objects for our data vectors using the <code>ts()</code> method. For this, we select the vector we would like to use as the first argument, and tune the <code>start</code> and <code>freq</code> (frequency) parameters. 

                Then we output the time-series data to the terminal by calling our newly-created time-series object.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                sp_500 <- ts(dataMaster$sp_500, start=c(1995, 1), freq=12)
            </code>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Then we output the time-series data to the terminal by calling our newly-created time-series object. Notice the nicely formatted data broken down into years and their respective months.

                PLOTTING OUR TIME SERIES
            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Plotting the data is arguably the most critical step in the exploratory analysis phase. This enables us to make inferences about important components of the time-series data, such as trend, seasonality, heteroskedasticity, and stationarity. Here is a quick summary of each:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trend</strong>: we say that a dataset has a trend when it has either a long-term increase or decrease.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seasonality</strong>: we say that a dataset has seasonality when it has patterns that repeat over known, fixed periods of time (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly).
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <strong>Heteroskedasticity</strong>: we say that a data is heteroskedastic when its variability is not constant (i.e. its variance increases or decreases as a function of the explanatory variable).
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stationarity</strong>: a stochastic process is called stationary if the mean and variance are constant (i.e. their joint distribution does not change over time).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
                <p>
                    We can plot our <code>sp_500</code> data object in R using the <code>plot()</code> method.
                </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                plot.ts(sp_500)

                Most of what we are seeing we had already identified but here we can see there are moments of decreasing trend but overall we can see that the time series is gradually increasing as time progresses. We can see there is seasonal components which is expected in financial and annual data. We will see later if they have a large influence in our model building.

                These models are used under the assumption of stationarity, we are not going to go into detail with respect to the theory since there already is a lot of documentation on that! But these models can be estimated with what are called autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function. The autocorrelation function tells you of the correlation of different data points at different time lags (lag is defined as an equal time interval h where we have a time t so the lagged value would be t-h). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next plots are in the <code>astsa</code> package, when wanting to deduce the orders of the models we will be using for the time series, the ACF and PACF plots are a helpful guide for this.

                These plots tell us that the model is not stationary and that we would should do a transformation to adjust this. We take a difference to get rid of the trend present in our data.

                TRANSFORMING OUR DATA TO ADJUST FOR NON-STATIONARITY
            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Because our time series and ACF/PACF plots indicate non-stationarity we have to make the necessary transformation to achieve stationarity. A way to make a time series object stationary is to find the difference between consecutive values, this allows for the mean to stabilize thereby making the time series object stationary which we then could estimate the ARIMA model from.

                The plot of the first difference seems to suggest stationarity so the next step is to check the ACF/PACF plots to see if it is stationary and if we can estimate a model from them!

                From these plots we deduce that our model best fits an MA(1) since there is the ACF cuts off at one significant lag and the PACf shows geometric decay. Recall we are examining the differenced time series so we have to use the combined model ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), thus our model is ARIMA(0, 1, 1) and we can continue forecasting.

            <h2>Build models</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                We decided to go with the Box-Jenkins approach and build an ARIMA model while also using other models to compare which produced the best outputs. WIthin the forecast package there is a function called auto.arima that yields the <em>best</em> model based on Akaike-Information-Criterion (AIC). The AIC is a measurement of quality for a model compared to others. So it one of many model selection in time series, although we do warn against just using this model without testing other models out since it has been known not to produce the best output.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                But the model we received from both the differenced data set and the original data set yielded the same result, and after testing we reached the same conclusion; that an ARIMA(0,1,1) model is our best fit. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                So we created a data frame with out the year 2015 and fit our model on this data to see how well the model predicts compared to the real data.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Here’s the code for removing and storing the actual values of 2015 in a separate data frame:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                dataMaster_TS <- dataMaster[-c(1:240),]
            <br/>
                dataMaster_2014df <- dataMaster[-c(241:252),]
            <br/>
                dataMaster_TR <- ts(dataMaster_2014df, start = c(1995, 1), freq = 12)
            <br/>
                sp500_TR <- dataMaster_TR[, 'sp_500']
            <br/>
                sp500_TR
            </code>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Due to the best model being ARIMA(0,1,1) we fitted the appropriate model using the Arima function in the forecast package:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                fit <- Arima(sp500_TR, order = c(0,1,1), include.drift=TRUE)
            </code>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Our next step was running residual diagnostics to ensure our residuals were white noise under our initial assumptions! So we used the tsdisplay function to check our residuals:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                tsdisplay(residuals(fit))

            <br/>
        <!-- END - IMG -->
            <p>
                We also decided to create a histogram of the residuals to give people another visualization of the normally distributed residuals!
            </p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                hist(residuals(fit), prob = TRUE)
            <br/>
                lines(density(residuals(fit))

        <!-- END - IMG -->
            <p>
                Although not perfect we can see that the residuals do display a normal distribution with outliers explained by the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We made a more in depth analysis of these assumptions on the 2nd iteration of this project if you would like to explore this version it is readily available!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus we believe we have found a model that follows all our assumptions, and we can continue to forecasting with this model!

                So with our model we proceeded to forecast using the forecast package (duh!).  We found our best model and we’ll forecast the values for the S&amp;P 500 for 2015. So we created a data frame where we removed the last 12 values from our sp_500 earlier, and created a separate data frame that contained these values. Again we would like to say that there is a more complex iteration of this with interactive plots using plotly, but the coding might be a bit complex for people doing any introductory time series project.

            <p>
                This should have a time series object for S&amp;P 500 from 1995-2014 and another time series object with the values for 2015. Here we forecasted for these values then added the actual values to see how it compared.

                Although this plot does tell us a lot we can barely see the values so the beauty of R is that we can change our x and y limits to get a better view of the actual vs predicted values for 2015! We may be repeating ourselves but there is another version with ggplot on the second iteration of the project! Thus we input this to get a closer view.

                Thus we can see the model gives a pretty good estimation for the forecast for the year 2015. It falls within the 95%/80% confidence intervals and follows the flow of the actual values, even though the actual values are really volatile!

                <p>
                    Our final step was comparing our model to other models to see which has the lowest accuracy measurement criterion. As suggested by Rob J Hyndman, these tools are better at measuring which model is best fit, because different functions in R use different parameters to measure AIC. So AIC isn’t comparable for different models.

                <p>
                    “In general, be careful comparing the AIC value between software packages as they may treat the constant term differently, and then the AIC values are not comparable. This is the most likely explanation here.” – Rob Hyndman Apr 12 at 23:39

                    (Important to note this was him responding to my question on Cross Validated section of the Stack Exchange website, we can’t stress enough the amount of information you can get there especially from the people who created most of these r packages!!!! - Raul)
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Thus with a lot of help from his Evaluating Forecast Accuracy lecture (found here https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5 ) we used other models to compare our own model to see how well it did compared to these simple methodologies:

                <p>
                    Thus our conclusion is that the ARIMA(0,1,1) with drift model is the best fit for our S&amp;P 500 data set and yields the best prediction for future values!

                <p>
                    There is much literature over the unreliability of using statistical tools to predict the stock market because of its uncertainty. We feel like with a time series analysis we can still gain an understanding of maybe how the U.S. economy can go. We have also provided another iteration of this project that goes into more detail and is catered to people who have more experience with R.
